# Contributing to LLM Prompt Collection

Thank you for considering contributing to this prompt collection! This document outlines the process for adding new prompts and improving existing ones.

## Adding a New Prompt

1. **Choose the right location**: Determine whether your prompt fits best in a category folder or a model-specific folder.
2. **Use the template**: Copy the template from `templates/prompt_template.md` and fill it out completely.
3. **Naming convention**: Name your file descriptively, using lowercase and hyphens (e.g., `code-review-prompt.md`).
4. **Include metadata**: Complete all metadata fields to make the prompt discoverable.
5. **Test your prompt**: Verify that the prompt works as expected with the specified model.

## Improving Existing Prompts

1. **Document changes**: When improving an existing prompt, add a note about what changed and why.
2. **Version tracking**: Consider adding a version history section if making significant changes.
3. **Respect the original**: Try to maintain the original intent of the prompt while improving it.

## Quality Guidelines

All prompts should:

1. **Be clear and specific**: The prompt should clearly communicate what it's asking the model to do.
2. **Include context**: Provide necessary background information.
3. **Be reusable**: Design prompts that can be adapted to different scenarios.
4. **Be ethical**: Prompts should not be designed to generate harmful, illegal, or unethical content.
5. **Include examples**: Where possible, include examples of expected inputs/outputs.
